## Welcome to Pokidex!
Pokidex is a simple native iOS app for demonstrating Swift 5.5's brand new structured concurrency. You will find demos of asynchronous and parallel streaming of data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) using new native concurrency and Combine. The app uses the MVVM architecture.
