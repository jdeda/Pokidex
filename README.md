## Welcome to Pokidex!
Pokidex is a simple native iOS app for demonstrating Swift 5.5's brand new structured concurrency. You will find demos of asynchronous and concurrent streaming of data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/)  using new native concurrency and Combine. Additionally, you will find two state management architectures, MVVM and Point-Free's [Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) (TCA). You will find implementation of TCA [0.47.2](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture/releases/tag/0.47.2) where the library integrated Swift's new concurrency rather than pure Combine and DispatchQueue for managing asynchrony and concurrency.
